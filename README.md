## Vue Website
This is a Website that **I** made in HTML5, CSS3 and Vue.js framework used in a Computer Science Class project.
Vue is used in this website just to improve the ergonomics of the site, by making easier for the user to change the language (EN -> FR or FR -> EN without reloading).

**It isn't an Vue app, it's a normal website that use Vue (so don't run in with npm run serve)**

**From my experience, it is better to run a local server (by opening the index.html in VSCode with Live-Server extension for example), otherwise, the JS will not be functionning**

(I did it alone, my mate did the game part of the project)
